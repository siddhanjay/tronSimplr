# Simplr

Expense sharing via smart contracts



Simplr is a decentralized Web 3.0 application to simplify splitting bills with friends and family on the blockchain. It is a great way for splitting dinner tabs , sharing expenses with friends on trips or coordinating household purchases with roommates.

Simplr keeps track of your contribution in shared expenses , allows you to make combined payments to vendors and ultimately calculates and refunds you back the leftover amount.Users start out by funding the smart contract with TRX tokens, adding friends to the group,making purchases using the contract and at the end, withdrawing the leftover money owed to them.
